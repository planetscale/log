# log ðŸªµ

PlanetScale's logger module. Implemented as a set of convenience functions providing a common configuration of the [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) logging library.  `zap` *"provides fast, structured, leveled logging."*

Logs emitted follow the standards from [PlanetScale Structure Logging (coda)](https://coda.io/d/Text-Book_dqagsnmBFI6/WIP-Structured-Logging_suS7P#_luvPS).

## Usage

```console
go get github.com/planetscale/log
```

`zap` provides two logging interfaces: `zap.Logger` and `zap.SugarLogger`. Zap describes each logger and how to choose between them:

> In contexts where performance is nice, but not critical, use the `zap.SugaredLogger`. It's 4-10x faster than other structured logging packages and supports both structured and printf-style logging. Like log15 and go-kit, the SugaredLogger's structured logging APIs are loosely typed and accept a variadic number of key-value pairs. (For more advanced use cases, they also accept strongly typed fields - see the [SugaredLogger.With](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/zap@v1.19.1#SugaredLogger.With) documentation for details.

> In the rare contexts where every microsecond and every allocation matter, use the `zap.Logger`. It's even faster than the SugaredLogger and allocates far less, but it only supports strongly-typed, structured logging.

### Examples:

**zap.Logger**:

```go
import "github.com/planetscale/log"

func main() {
  logger := log.NewPlanetScaleLogger()
  defer logger.Sync()

  logger.Info("info log with fields",
    // Structured context as typed key-value pairs
    zap.String("user_id", "12345678"),
    zap.String("branch_id", "xzyhnkhpi12"),
  )
}
```

**zap.SugarLogger**:

```go
import "github.com/planetscale/log"

func main() {
  logger := log.NewPlanetScaleSugarLogger()
  defer logger.Sync()

  logger.Infof("info log printf example: %v", "foo")

  logger.Infow("info log with fields",
    // Structured context as loosely typed key-value pairs.
    "user_id", "12345678",
    "branch_id", "xzyhnkhpi12",
  )
}
```

Additional customizations to the logger config may be obtained by calling the `NewPlanetScaleConfig()` function to return a pre-configured `zap.Config` which can be further customized before calling `.Build()` to create a `zap.Logger`. Example:

```go
  // disable the `caller` field in logs:
  cfg := log.NewPlanetScaleConfig()
  logger, _ := cfg.Build(zap.WithCaller(false))
  defer logger.Sync()
```

See [./examples](./examples).

### glog

Many PlanetScale applications use the [github.com/golang/glog](https://github.com/golang/glog) library which is commonly used in Vitess and Kuberenetes client libraries. Glog has some interesting properties, namely that it hooks into `flags` for configuration and causes libraries that use it to output their own logs, regardless of the application's logging config. When combined with this library you will end up with an application that is mixing structured JSON logs from `zap` with plain-text logs from `glog`.

Using [noglog](https://github.com/planetscale/noglog) the `glog` library's log calls can be replaced with our logger such that all logs emitted by the application are in a common, structured, JSON format.

1. Add the following to your `go.mod`:

```golang
require (
    github.com/google/glog master
)

replace github.com/google/glog => github.com/planetscale/noglog master
```

2. Replace `glog's` log calls with our SugaredLogger:

```golang
  logger, _ := log.NewPlanetScaleSugarLogger()
  defer logger.Sync()

  glog.SetLogger(&glog.LoggerFunc{
    DebugfFunc: func(f string, a ...interface{}) { logger.Debugf(f, a...) },
    InfofFunc:  func(f string, a ...interface{}) { logger.Infof(f, a...) },
    WarnfFunc:  func(f string, a ...interface{}) { logger.Warnf(f, a...) },
    ErrorfFunc: func(f string, a ...interface{}) { logger.Errorf(f, a...) },
  })
```

If using the `zap.Logger` call `.Sugar()` to get a SugaredLogger first:

```golang
  logger, _ := log.NewPlanetScaleLogger()
  defer logger.Sync()

  slogger := logger.Sugar()
  glog.SetLogger(&glog.LoggerFunc{
    DebugfFunc: func(f string, a ...interface{}) { slogger.Debugf(f, a...) },
    InfofFunc:  func(f string, a ...interface{}) { slogger.Infof(f, a...) },
    WarnfFunc:  func(f string, a ...interface{}) { slogger.Warnf(f, a...) },
    ErrorfFunc: func(f string, a ...interface{}) { slogger.Errorf(f, a...) },
  })

```

## Development mode

All logs are emitted as JSON by default. Sometimes this can be difficult to read. Set the `PS_DEV_MODE=1` environment variable to switch into a more human friendly log format.
